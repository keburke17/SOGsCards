## BTC Questions
* Is it possible to ‘send tx’ in multi-sig? i.e. wallet shows pop-up? Pop-up if in app waiting room?


# Ordinal Theory
* Runes vs inscriptions
    * Runes are fungible tokens
        * The process of creating a Bitcoin rune is called “etching”. This involves creating a “genesis” UTXO including the details of the rune’s name, symbol, decimals, and total supply
        * Runes stores all data, including etching, minting, and transfer messages in OP_RETURN.
    * Ordinals are non-fungible tokens
        * Stores data in the witness part of a transaction
    * Both should be native and taproot compatiable; and lightning compatible
